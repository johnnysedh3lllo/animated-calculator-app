# Basic Vintage-designed Calculator App

## Introduction

A calculator app that can perform basic arithmetic operations and a few extra features for the fun of it.

## Usage

To use the calculator app, click on the URL, then first turn on the calculator by clicking the power button to enable button usage. Begin entering numbers and operations. The app will display the result of each calculation as you go.

- You can turn off the sound if you prefer the sound off, this can be achieved by clicking the sound button or pressing "M" on your keyboard.
- You can also delete a character by pressing "D" on your keyboard and clear the screen by pressing "C" as well as clicking the buttons on the screen.
- Calculating the square of a number can be done by pressing the multiplication key twice eg: "5^2" can be written as "5\*\*".

I'm always excited at the opportunity to learn practical, efficient, and overall effective ways of implementation. so if you have any feedback in regards to how the app works, how my code was structured, and any way I could've better written it. Please feel free to reach me at [h3llloworld](wwww.twitter.com/h3llloworld) on Twitter. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
